This repository contains all the work I have done for the project 4 of the OpenClassRooms DataScientist training. This project consist of proposing energy consumption and CO2 consommation estimation models for the city of Seattle (for non-residential building). Several step of data analysis have been done. EDA, filtering and model training have been done. It contains four files:

- A Jupyter notebook codes (python) with an EDA and filtering to keep data needed for modeling. 
- A Jupyter notebook codes (python) with several model training and selection of one for each target values.
- French presentation of the project (in odp and pdf)

The data used for this project can be find on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/city-of-seattle/sea-building-energy-benchmarking
